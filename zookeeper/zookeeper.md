# What is ZooKeepr
> ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing 
  distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are 
  used in some form or another by distributed applications. Each time they are implemented there 
  is a lot of work that goes into fixing the bugs and race conditions that are inevitable. Because 
  of the difficulty of implementing these kinds of services, applications initially usually skimp 
  on them ,which make them brittle in the presence of change and difficult to manage. Even when done 
  correctly, different implementations of these services lead to management complexity when the 
> applications are deployed.
